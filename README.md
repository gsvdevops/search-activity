## Helpful Resources
* VueJS Docs: https://vuejs.org/
* JavaScript: There are many resources out there. MDN (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) is one of our go-tos. freeCodeCamp offers a lot of material. We recommend just going through their Basic Javascript curriculum (https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript).
